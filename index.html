          <p class="aboutme-desc">I am a computer science sophomore studying in UC Davis, with passion in web
            development
            and data science. I
            participated in my first hackathon in 2020, and I loved it ever since. I've been hiking
            around NorCal quite a bit, and Lake Tahoe will be my next (after the pandemic)! I am born and raised in Hong
            Kong before coming to
            Davis.</p>

          <p class="project-desc">I created this mobile app to keep track of my spendings and offer insights about my
            consumption pattern, such as how frequent will I need to replenish groceries. This is my first time doing
            mobile development. I use Expo to publish my project, but I could not quite make it public to everyone.</p>

          <p class="project-desc">I have been a big fan of soccer (or football in Brit. English), and Chelsea is my
            favorite team. I started this project after the season resumed in June 2020 in light of the pandemic. The
            website keeps track of every match Chelsea played and my ratings on the players. I am able to watch every
            game since it's summer, and hopefully I can continue this when school starts.</p>

          <p class="project-desc">As a nature lover, I always enjoy hiking. I was joined with 2 other teammates that I
            met in Backyard Hacks, a virtual hackathon, and work on a website that recommends which hiking trails near
            you have the best weather conditions.</p>

          <p class="project-desc">I love listening to music, and I always wanted to know more about my music taste
            through numbers. That's why I created this website where users can check their top artists, tracks, and

          <p class="project-desc">My team and I chose this idea because one of the tracks of SacHacks 2020 was
            E-sports, and the E-sports market is growing rapidly. We performed statistical analysis on each team and
            player of the league, and display their rankings and comparisons based on user's input (such as number of
            rebounds or blocks).</p>

          <p class="project-desc">The story of this idea was that I found so much posts on Facebook about students' lost
            items, be it a HydroFlask full of memorable stickers or a Walmart bike. We created this website in HackDavis
            2020 for Davis students to recover their possessions.</p>
